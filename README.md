# Flutter online Shopping(ShopSphere) App with Admin Panel

## Purpose  
This project is a Flutter-based mobile application designed to provide users with a platform to browse products, manage their accounts, and place orders. It also includes a comprehensive admin panel for managing users, products, orders, and notifications.

## Technologies and Frameworks  
- **Flutter**: For building the cross-platform mobile application.

The image appears to depict a MongoDB Compass interface, showing the structure of a database named `online-Shopping` with a collection named `users`. Below is a breakdown of the database structure based on the provided content:

---

### **Database Structure**

#### **Database Name**: `online-Shopping`

#### **Collections**:
1. **`users`**  
   - This collection stores user-related data.
   - Each document in the `users` collection contains the following fields:

| Field Name   | Data Type               | Example Value                                      |
|--------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `_id`        | ObjectId                | `ObjectId('9?a4fbe3766fab768b88ee3')`             |
| `name`       | String                  | `"admin"`                                         |
| `email`      | String                  | `"admin@gmail.com"`                               |
| `password`   | String                  | `"5255-1950X19j10e9FnddNNUlgLcOcpmA1fZnIVnvEubB8HNK74fa7311cc1"` |
| `phone`      | String                  | `"09875553211"`                                   |
| `address`    | String                  | `"Libror"`                                        |
| `answer`     | String                  | `"football"`                                      |
| `role`       | Integer                 | `0`                                               |
| `createAt`   | ISODate (Timestamp)     | `2025-02-06T18:13:55.683+00:00`                   |
| `updateAt`   | ISODate (Timestamp)     | `2025-02-06T18:14:49.879+00:00`                   |
| `__v`        | Integer                 | `0`                                               |

#### **Other Collections in `online-Shopping` Database**:
- **`categories`**: Likely stores product categories.
- **`online-users`**: Possibly tracks currently active or logged-in users.
- **`orders`**: Likely stores order-related data.
- **`products`**: Likely stores product-related data.

---

### **Key Observations**:
1. **User Roles**:
   - The `role` field in the `users` collection is an integer (`0` in the example). This likely represents user roles (e.g., `0` for admin, `1` for regular users).

2. **Timestamps**:
   - `createAt` and `updateAt` fields track when the user was created and last updated, respectively.

3. **Security**:
   - Passwords are stored as hashed strings (likely using a secure hashing algorithm).

4. **Database Management**:
   - MongoDB Compass is used to manage and query the database.
   - The interface allows for adding, updating, and deleting data.

### **Example Document in `users` Collection**:
```json
{
  "_id": ObjectId("9?a4fbe3766fab768b88ee3"),
  "name": "admin",
  "email": "admin@gmail.com",
  "password": "5255-1950X19j10e9FnddNNUlgLcOcpmA1fZnIVnvEubB8HNK74fa7311cc1",
  "phone": "09875553211",
  "address": "Libror",
  "answer": "football",
  "role": 0,
  "createAt": ISODate("2025-02-06T18:13:55.683Z"),
  "updateAt": ISODate("2025-02-06T18:14:49.879Z"),
  "__v": 0
}
```
